<h2 class="subtitle"> <i>A Chamber Opera</i></h2>

<div class="content">
XOR (“ex-or”) is a chamber opera composed by Jessy Eubanks, incorporating a computer-generated, Shakespearian-style libretto and live electronics in an epic science fiction melodrama.
<br><br>
Together the text and music explore the influence of imperfect humanity on the machines they create, both in their content and process of creation. The score by Jessy Eubanks utilizes both acoustic and electronic sounds, including live processed vocals, while the libretto by Christian Clark and Brian Ellis, was created by selectively utilizing materials generated through Google’s TensorFlow machine learning framework. 
All performances will be held in the UT Lab Theater, located at 303 East 24th Street, Austin, TX 78712.
