John Cage and Merce Cunningham. Leonard Bernstein and Jerome Robbins. Andy Warhol and The Velvet Underground. Shakespeare and Morley. Since basically forever, artists of all kinds have worked together with musicians to create thought-provoking art. Our medium is sound. Maybe yours is sculpture, the written word, French pastry, or computer-generated animations. Whatever the case, we want to create interesting art with you.
