<div class="content">
The Good House Collective is a collection of musicians based in Austin, Texas focused on performing new classical and classically inspired music. We collaborate with artists (musical and otherwise) in our own city and across the U.S. to explore what their art sounds like. Our performances happen in a variety of locations, but whether in an art gallery, elementary school, or in our own houses, we want audiences to feel at home.
